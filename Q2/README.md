# ENSE 370 Winter 2019 Midterm Exam - Question 2

**PROMPT**: Consider a car manufacturer that assembles different trim levels of a car: 
1. Basic – has all the basic features of a car, e.g. basic engine, basic seats, etc. 
2. Luxury – has everything the Basic version has except that it has a larger engine and leather seats instead of the basic engine and seats. 
3. Sports – has everything the Basic version has except that it has a fuel-injection engine and bucket seats instead of the basic engine and seats.

PART A: Design a system that can easily allow other trim levels of a car to be created and added  to the system. State the design pattern (if any) that you use. Draw the Class diagram.  You are free not to include any methods in your class diagram, but you must include the two characteristics “engine” and “seats”.

PART B: Assume that all the classes in your diagram in Part A above had been implemented. Write the Java code for the main() method to create one instance of the Luxury  trim, and one instance of the Sports trim. You may give your public class any name that you like.
