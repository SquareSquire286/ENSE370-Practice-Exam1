# ENSE 370 Winter 2019 Midterm Exam - Question 1

**PROMPT:** Consider a fast-food ordering system. The system has the following functionalities:
1. Add an order
2. Remove an order (it could be due to the completion or cancellation of the order)
3. Make payment

There are two users of the system, Customer and Operator. The customer can add or cancel an order, bt the operator can only remove an order after it is completed. Note that a customer cannot add an order unless he has made payment, and he cannot make payment first without trying to place an order.

PART B: Suppose the fast-food ordering system has the following components:
1. Menu Selection Module - for input of fast-food orders
2. Order Completion Module - for updating the system that an order is ready
3. Payment Module - for making payments

Draw the Class diagram including associations to the users of the system.
