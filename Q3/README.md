# ENSE 370 Winter 2019 Midterm Exam - Question 3

**PROMPT:** Consider a travel planning application where there can be multiple ways to travel from one destination to another, e.g. by flight, by boat, by train, by bus, etc. This is best achieved using the Strategy Pattern which allows the mode of travel to be changed at run time. The class diagram is shown in the figure below:



Write the Java code for the three classes Strategy, Context, and StrategyPatternDemo. You may assume that all the other classes are fully implemented. In the `main()` method, create a Context variable for the ByBus mode of travel and do the action.

*NOTE: The 'StrategyPatternDemo' class is called 'Main' in my solution.*
